        <TimelineEvent.Description>
          As a Frontend Developer at KLwebco, I have worked on building
          responsive and interactive web applications using React.js and
          Next.js. My responsibilities include translating complex design
          concepts into pixel-perfect, mobile-first web interfaces using HTML5,
          CSS3, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I have optimized web performance
          through server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG),
          ensuring seamless user experiences. I prioritize cross-browser
          compatibility and adhere to accessibility standards and SEO best
          practices. Collaborating closely with designers and development teams,
          I have delivered high-quality, scalable solutions while maintaining
          clean, version-controlled codebases using Git and Bitbucket. I am
          committed to staying updated with the latest frontend technologies to
          enhance project outcomes and drive innovation.
